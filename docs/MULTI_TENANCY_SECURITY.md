## Vulnerabilities Found

### Critical (5 vulnerabilities - ALL FIXED ✅)

#### 1. **attachments.py - Complete Multi-Tenancy Bypass** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Impact:** ANY user could upload, view, download, modify, or delete files from ANY department
- **Risk:** Confidential document exposure, data breach
- **Affected Endpoints:** All 6 endpoints
  - POST /{expense_id}/attachments
  - GET /{expense_id}/attachments
  - GET /attachments/{attachment_id}
  - GET /attachments/{attachment_id}/download
  - PATCH /attachments/{attachment_id}
  - DELETE /attachments/{attachment_id}
- **Fix:** Added `check_expense_department_access()` function to verify department ownership through parent expense

#### 2. **analytics.py - Missing Critical Imports** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Impact:** ALL analytics endpoints would crash at runtime with NameError
- **Missing Imports:** `UserRoleEnum`, `status`
- **Affected Endpoints:** 11 endpoints (entire module unusable)
- **Fix:** Added missing imports to line 2 and line 8

#### 3. **budget.py - Missing Critical Import** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Impact:** ALL budget endpoints would crash at runtime with NameError
- **Missing Import:** `UserRoleEnum`
- **Affected Endpoints:** 11 endpoints (entire module unusable)
- **Fix:** Added `UserRoleEnum` to imports on line 10

#### 4. **budget.py - USER Role Bypass on /init** ⚠️ HIGH
- **Impact:** USER could initialize budget plans for other departments
- **Attack:** `POST /budget/plans/year/2026/init?department_id=2` as dept1 user
- **Fix:** Added role check to force USER to their own department only

#### 5. **budget.py - USER Role Bypass on /copy-from** ⚠️ HIGH
- **Impact:** USER could copy budget plans for other departments
- **Attack:** `POST /budget/plans/year/2026/copy-from/2025?department_id=2` as dept1 user
- **Fix:** Added role check to force USER to their own department only

---

### High Severity (2 issues - Remaining)

#### 6. **analytics.py - /plan-vs-actual Data Leakage**
- **Impact:** MANAGER/ADMIN could see aggregated data from all departments without explicit filter
- **Recommendation:** Require explicit `department_id` parameter for MANAGER/ADMIN

#### 7. **analytics.py - /budget-status Incomplete Validation**
- **Impact:** MANAGER with dept_id=None could see cross-department data
- **Recommendation:** Validate department_id is not None before queries

---

### Moderate Severity (4 issues - Remaining)

#### 8-9. **contractors.py - Bulk Operations Silent Failure**
- **Impact:** Bulk update/delete may silently skip IDs from other departments
- **Recommendation:** Add validation that all requested IDs were found

#### 10-11. **kpi.py - MANAGER Inconsistency**
- **Impact:** MANAGER cannot filter by department in 2 KPI endpoints (inconsistent with other endpoints)
- **Affected:** GET /employee-kpi-goals, GET /analytics/bonus-distribution
- **Recommendation:** Allow optional department_id filter for MANAGER

## Role-Based Access Control

### USER Role ✅
- ✅ Forced to own department in all operations
- ✅ Cannot view data from other departments
- ✅ Cannot create/modify data in other departments
- ✅ Cannot bypass department_id parameter

### MANAGER Role ✅
- ✅ Can optionally filter by department_id
- ✅ Sees all departments when no filter specified
- ⚠️ 2 endpoints lack optional filter (minor inconsistency)

### ADMIN Role ✅
- ✅ Full access to all departments
- ✅ Can filter by specific department
- ✅ Can manage system-wide data

## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Endpoints

When creating new API endpoints, follow this pattern:

```python
from app.db.models import UserRoleEnum

@router.get("/your-endpoint")
def your_endpoint(
    department_id: Optional[int] = None,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    """Your endpoint description"""

    # STEP 1: Build base query
    query = db.query(YourModel)

    # STEP 2: Apply department filtering based on role
    if current_user.role == UserRoleEnum.USER:
        # USER: Force to own department
        if not current_user.department_id:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="User has no assigned department"
            )
        query = query.filter(YourModel.department_id == current_user.department_id)
    elif current_user.role in [UserRoleEnum.MANAGER, UserRoleEnum.ADMIN]:
        # MANAGER/ADMIN: Optional department filter
        if department_id:
            query = query.filter(YourModel.department_id == department_id)

    # STEP 3: Continue with other filters and execute query
    items = query.all()
    return items
```

### For Entities Without Direct department_id

If your entity doesn't have direct `department_id`, check through parent:

```python
@router.get("/items/{item_id}")
def get_item(
    item_id: int,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    item = db.query(Item).filter(Item.id == item_id).first()
    if not item:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Not found")

    # Get parent entity with department_id
    parent = db.query(Parent).filter(Parent.id == item.parent_id).first()
    if not parent:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Parent not found")

    # Check department access through parent
    if current_user.role == UserRoleEnum.USER:
        if parent.department_id != current_user.department_id:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=403,
                detail="Access denied: You can only access items from your own department"
            )

    return item
```
