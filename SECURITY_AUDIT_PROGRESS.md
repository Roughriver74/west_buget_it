# Multi-Tenancy Security Audit Progress Report

## Executive Summary

**Critical Security Audit in Progress** - Fixing 40+ cross-department data access vulnerabilities across the IT Budget Manager application.

**Status**: 16 out of 40+ vulnerabilities fixed (40% complete)

## Progress Overview

### ✅ Phase 1: COMPLETED (13 vulnerabilities fixed)

#### forecast.py - ALL 7 endpoints secured
- ✅ POST `/generate` - added department_id access validation
- ✅ GET `/` - added department_id access validation
- ✅ POST `/` - added department_id validation for creation
- ✅ PUT `/{id}` - added department_id ownership check
- ✅ DELETE `/{id}` - added department_id ownership check + missing current_user dependency
- ✅ DELETE `/clear/{year}/{month}` - added department_id validation + missing dependency
- ✅ GET `/export/{year}/{month}` - added role-based filtering with mandatory department_id

**Helper**: Added `check_department_access()` function for consistent validation

#### expenses.py - ALL 6 endpoints secured
- ✅ GET `/{id}` - added department_id ownership check for USER role
- ✅ PUT `/{id}` - added department_id ownership check for USER role
- ✅ PATCH `/{id}/status` - added department_id ownership check for USER role
- ✅ PATCH `/{id}/mark-reviewed` - added department_id ownership check for USER role
- ✅ DELETE `/{id}` - added department_id ownership check for USER role
- ✅ GET `/stats/totals` - added role-based department filtering

---

### 🔄 Phase 2: IN PROGRESS (3/8 vulnerabilities fixed)

#### analytics.py - 3 out of 8 endpoints secured

**Fixed:**
- ✅ GET `/dashboard` - added role-based department filtering
  - USER restricted to own department
  - Fixed CAPEX/OPEX queries missing department filtering
- ✅ GET `/budget-execution` - added department_id parameter and role-based filtering
- ✅ GET `/by-category` - added role-based department filtering

**Remaining (5 endpoints):**
- ❌ GET `/trends` - needs department_id parameter
- ❌ GET `/payment-calendar` - needs logic error fix in dept_id usage
- ❌ GET `/payments-by-day` - needs USER role enforcement
- ❌ GET `/payment-forecast` - needs department_id support (service layer changes required)
- ❌ GET `/payment-forecast/summary` - needs department_id support (service layer changes required)

---

### 📋 Phase 3: NOT STARTED (budget.py - 9 endpoints)

**File**: `backend/app/api/v1/budget.py`

**Critical vulnerabilities identified:**
- ❌ GET `/plans` - completely unfiltered
- ❌ GET `/plans/{plan_id}` - no department validation
- ❌ POST `/plans` - no department validation
- ❌ PUT `/plans/{plan_id}` - no department validation
- ❌ DELETE `/plans/{plan_id}` - no department validation
- ❌ GET `/summary` - no department filtering
- ❌ GET `/plans/year/{year}/export` - exports all department data
- ⚠️ GET `/plans/year/{year}` - optional filtering (needs enforcement)
- ⚠️ GET `/overview/{year}/{month}` - optional filtering (needs enforcement)

**Reference pattern**: `categories.py` has correct implementation - use as template

---

### 📋 Phase 4: NOT STARTED (kpi, payroll, categories - 4-5 endpoints)

#### kpi.py - 3 endpoints
- ❌ GET `/employee-kpi-goals` - MANAGER can see all departments
- ❌ GET `/bonus-distribution` - MANAGER can see all departments
- ❌ POST `/import` - can import employees without department validation

#### payroll.py - 1 endpoint
- ❌ POST `/import-payroll-plans` - MANAGER can import employees from any department (Line 1215-1219)

#### categories.py - 1 endpoint
- ❌ POST `/bulk/delete` - missing validation check (like bulk_update has)

---

## Security Impact

### Before Fixes:
- **USER** role could access/modify data from ANY department
- Cross-department data leakage in analytics and reports
- No department ownership validation on individual record access
- Export functions exposed all departments' data

### After Fixes:
- **USER** role strictly restricted to own department
- **MANAGER/ADMIN** retain full cross-department access
- Department ownership validated on all record operations
- Export functions respect role-based permissions

## Commits Made

1. **`d2d796b`** - security: fix critical multi-tenancy vulnerabilities in forecast and expenses APIs (Phase 1)
2. **`21b0458`** - security: fix 3 critical vulnerabilities in analytics API (Phase 2 partial)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 2**: Fix remaining 5 endpoints in analytics.py
   - Requires service layer changes for payment forecast endpoints

2. **Execute Phase 3**: Fix all 9 endpoints in budget.py
   - High priority - budget data is highly sensitive
   - Use categories.py as reference implementation

3. **Execute Phase 4**: Fix remaining 4-5 endpoints in kpi/payroll/categories
   - Medium/Low priority

4. **Testing**: Write comprehensive multi-tenancy security tests
   - Test USER can't access other departments' data
   - Test MANAGER/ADMIN retain cross-department access
   - Test 404 (not 403) returned for unauthorized access

5. **Documentation**: Create `docs/MULTI_TENANCY_SECURITY.md`
   - Document security patterns
   - List all audited endpoints
   - Provide examples for future development

---

## Estimated Remaining Work

- **Phase 2 completion**: 2-3 hours (service layer changes required)
- **Phase 3 (budget.py)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 4 (misc)**: 1-2 hours
- **Testing**: 3-4 hours
- **Documentation**: 1-2 hours

**Total remaining**: 9-14 hours

---

## Technical Debt Addressed

✅ Implemented consistent `check_department_access()` helper function
✅ Added role-based filtering pattern across multiple endpoints
✅ Documented security requirements in docstrings
✅ Added proper HTTP status codes (403 for permission denied)
